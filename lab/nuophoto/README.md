========

> A JavaScript/HTML5 canvas image editor

A nice editor built using imgEditor. At the moment they are the same project although as things move on I will probably separate them and create two independent projects. imgEditor will become a JS img library with editing functions and such, hopefully with less dependance on the canvas element.

Nuophoto will become a nice gui to interact with it and test it out.


Requirements:
-------

- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
- [requireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs)
- [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
- imgEditor
- workspace	(Just some gui functions bundled together)

Try it out:
------

Still in alpha stage of development. If you want to test the latest build check out:

*Note: It takes Github 10 min and up to 10 hours to update the code in gh-pages*

Roadmap
------
I think it will be interesting to start tracking features I think the editor must have, so from now on.
*Some of these are simply ideas I have, I might not develop them*
